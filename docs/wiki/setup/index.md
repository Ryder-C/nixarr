title: Setup the applications
---

Here are some guides to help you set up the applications. We assume you left the
default ports; if you changed them, you will need to change the ports in the
URLs. Same if you are using a domain nameâ€”change the URLs to match. We assume
you are using the [first example](/wiki/examples/example-1) in your Nix
configuration. Replace {URL} in this document with your server IP or domain.
(You also can remove the port if not needed)
